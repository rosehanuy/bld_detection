The error resulted in a minor bias that was most prevalent in pixels at the edge of flightlines and in the NIR region of the spectrum. Errors generally ranged from 0.1-0.3%, which is well within documented uncertainty limits of 5%. Note that due to the selection of nadir-most pixels in the mosaic product, the most heavily influenced flightline edge pixels are less likely to be transferred to the mosaic product.",
